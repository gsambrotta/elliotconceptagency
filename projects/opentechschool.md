OpenTechSchool is a non-profit organization dedicated to make tech education free and open to everybody.

When our developer arrived, the organisation already had a website but it needed a strong restyling.

To build the new platform correctly, she had to take into consideration the 4 groups that use OpenTechSchool: Students, Coaches, Organisers, and Sponsors. This was the biggest challenge of the project. Through a very narrowed and specific UX process, she has been able to come up with a new design that would work for all 4 groups.

<blockquote>
Each of these groups, in fact, would use the platform in different ways but, at the same time, she had to make sure that they could all find the information they needed very quickly and easily.

This brand, moreover, had several requirements:

- Open Source Friendliness - She had to make sure that different types of people, technical and non, could easily access and edit the content
- Flexibility - The platform had to be built in a way that would facilitate a potential migration
- Data Friendly - The website had to merge data from different third-party libraries

In order to meet all these requirements, the website has been written with Nextjs: a React
