Elliot for Water is our brand sister, and it’s a social enterprise, founded by Andrea Demichelis, with the mission of providing millions of people with access to safe drinking water. The idea behind it is very simple: giving everyone the opportunity to have an impact on the world. Elliot for Water is like any other search engine but with the extra characteristic that it donates 60% of our profit to realize clean water projects. Very simply: you search the web, ads generate money, and that money finances water projects.

The work done with Elliot for Water included: Marketing, Public Relations, Social Media Management, Technical Development, and Strategic Partnerships.

On the business side, we closed collaborations with both international charities and big corporates like Well Found and Microsoft.

Our marketing strategies included

- Presenting the project during the Universal Exposition in Milan with a weekly stand inside the international fair
- Running PR campaigns both online and offline
- Creating original content for the Social Media
- Creating collaborations with different schools that installed the search engine in their classes
- Creating an original design for the search engine that would invite people to use Elliot for Water
- Taking part in events where Andrea talked as a guest speaker

<blockquote>
One of the events that we have been able to take part in has been the OHM Live: a charity event that brought together celebrities like Ricky Martin, Jason Derulo, Dua Lipa, and Cardi B, and where Andrea talked as representative of the United Nation’s Sustainable Goal number 6, Water and Sanitation.
</blockquote>

Thanks to the work realized in the years, we have been able to reach 600,000 users, donate more than 1 million liters of water, and get featured in TV shows, radios, magazines, podcasts.

Among the media that featured our work we can find: The Guardian, Cause Artist, London Live, Radio 105, and Disruptive Conversations.

As far as the technical side is concerned, the search engine is a very complex platform to realize and we had to take into consideration many factors before diving into the development such as:

- Scalability
- User-friendliness
- Opportunity to go open-source
- How easy it would be to bring new developers in
- Responsiveness
- Reliability
- Compatibility with different APIs

After considering every aspect, we decided to build Elliot for Water using .Net in the back-end and React on the front-end. The search results, as well as the search ads, are provided by the API from Bing thanks to the collaboration with Microsoft we mentioned above.
